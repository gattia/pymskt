Test file for meniscal coverage computation.

TODO: Implement tests for:
- Testing coverage calculation with synthetic data (known coverage values)
- Testing with 100% coverage (meniscus covers all cartilage)
- Testing with 0% coverage (no meniscus above cartilage)
- Testing with partial coverage
- Testing SI ray casting functionality
- Testing area calculation accuracy
- Testing with different SI tolerance values
- Edge cases: empty compartments, missing meniscus data
